## About the book:

In this book you learn how to built and programm your senseBox:home. Additionally, you learn a lot about how the measurement station, how the data is transmitted and how to integrate the data on openSenseMap.

Before you start, please read this introduction. It will help you to understand the book and gives you insights into the structure of the book.

## Introduction
The senseBox:home book is mainly done for owners of the senseBox:home, but also for all interested people which want to get in contact with senseBox. This senseBox:home is a DIY project, this means you decide on your own how you senseBox will look like and which data will be collected.You always have the option to adapt more sensors afterwards to your senseBox to measure fine dust, UV and illumination, air preasure or even NOx. All this data you can be upload on [openSenseMap](https://opensensemap.org/) to share them with all other senseBox owners as "open data" and to observe and interpret the data history of your senseBox.

This book will help you first to do the [Erste Schritte](erste-schritte/software-installation.md) with your senseBox:home. Afterwards, it explains you the several components and their features. Finally, you find some information about common issues and frequently asked questions.

On your way through the book you will be guided with the side bar on the left side and the green arrow buttons. Each chapter has a small introduction in a grey boy with green letters about the content of the page at the beginning. 

This will look like this:

#Headline
<div class="description">
This is the content which will be in the chapter.
</div>
<div class="line">
    <br>
</div>
<br>
Moreover we added some notice boxes for specific content. There are four types of boxes:

<div class="box_info">
    <i class="fa fa-info fa-fw" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #42acf3;"></i>
    This type of notice shows you Information such as links to additional information sources or advanced background knowledge.</div>

<div class="box_success">
    <i class="fa fa-check fa-fw" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #50af51;"></i>
   This type of notice contains a checklist. The checklist is typically a summary about the things you should have done in the chapter.
    With the list you can check if you did not forget any important steps.
</div>

<div class="box_warning">
    <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-fw" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #f0ad4e"></i>
    This type of notice is a warning sign. It guides your attention at situations in the book in which you have to work very carefully.</div>

<div class="box_error">
    <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #d9534f"></i>
    This type of notice informs you about typical errors. It shows you for example what you can do if you already did a mistake.
</div>

In extension we offer some passages which are hidden. They contain information about further topics and examples. If you click on this passage it will drop out. Here is an example for a hidden passage:

{% collapse title="Ein versteckter Absatz" %}
 Nice, you got it! Click again on the gread headline to hide this passage again.
{% endcollapse %}

The last element in this book which you should familiar with are "tabs". You will know them from your internet browser to open more than one websites at the same time. In this book we use tabs to reduce the content of the page and let you only see what you really need. An example is that we use them to display differences between the operating systems (Windows, OSX(Mac) and Linux). In the most cases you will only be interested in one of the operating systems, so just click on the tab with the system you use. Just try it in the following example:
{% tabs first="First Tab", second="Second Tab", third="Third Tab" %}
{% content "first" %}
# First tab
The first tab is opened initially.

{% content "second" %}
# Second tab
You chose the second tab.

{% content "third" %}
# Third tab
You got it! You opended the third tab.  

{% endtabs %}
<div class="line" style="border-bottom: solid 1px #a6a6a6!important;">
    <br>
</div>

You checked out the tabs and all the other elements of the book?

Then you can start now with your senseBox:home! 

We wish you a lot of fun!
