# Firmware Update Wifi-Bee {#head}
<div class="description">Unfortunately, some of our WINC1500 WiFi Bees have outdated firmware (version 19.4.4) installed. Unfortunately, there is no other way to update this firmware than to do it manually. The following chapter explains how to find out which firmware you are using and (if you have an outdated version) how to update it.</div>

    With latest Arduino IDE 1.8.8 release it currently is not possible to update the firmware of our WINC1500 WiFi Bee. Therefore, you need to install the previous release Arduino IDE 1.8.7. You will find the download at the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#previous">Previous IDE Releases</a> on the Arduino website.
</div>

## Test the Version
First, it must be found out which version the supplied WiFi Bee has. Go to `File` > `Examples` and under `"Examples for senseBox MCU"` on `Test_WINC1500`.

Now upload the sketch to your board (by clicking the arrow icon). Note that the WiFi Bee must be plugged into your senseBox board (please plug it in to XBEE1). Then click on the serial monitor (by clicking the magnifying glass icon) and it will be checked if your Wifi-Bee is functional and shows which firmware is installed on it.

   If you have a firmware  <b>19.5.2, or higher</b> you can cancel here. Your WiFi Bee works perfectly.

    If you have a firmware <b>lower than 19.5.2</b> you unfortunately have to update the firmware. You will find out how this works in the next step.

## WiFi-Bee Firmware Update
To update the firmware, follow the path from the top: `File` > ` Examples ` and under `"Examples for senseBox MCU"` on `WINC1500_Updater`.

Now load the sketch on your board (by clicking the arrow icon), on which the WiFi Bee is plugged (please plug it on XBEE1).

    Do not open the serial monitor this time (do not click on the magnifying glass icon)!
</div>

Now click `Tools` and select `Wifi101 Firmware Updater`.

![Choose Wifi 101 Firmware Updater](../../pictures/Update-Wifi-Firmware/4-firmware-updater.PNG)

First, you can test the connection by clicking on the ` COM Port ` and then on ` Test connection `. The following information should come back: `"The programmer is working!"`

Almost done, now just click on ` Update Firmware ` and the upload starts. Then a success message should appear: `"The firmware has been updated!"`

    Do not let yourself be confused that there is also a version of the firmware 19.5.4, but this is not found in Arduino if you want to update the firmware. This firmware will be integrated with the Arduino Release 1.8.6 and will be available from then on.</div>
    
   We apologize for the detour and wish you lots of fun with the senseBox.
