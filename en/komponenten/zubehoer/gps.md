# GPS {#head}
<div class="description">The GPS-Modul receives the position (longitude/latidude/altitude) of your senseBox. You can use that values to create mobile senseBox and e.g. send the data to the openSenseMap. The sensor is compatible with four GNS systems (GPS, QZSS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo) and is based on the u-blox CAM-M8Q Multi GNSS modul.</div>
