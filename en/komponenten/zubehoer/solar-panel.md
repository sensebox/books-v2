## Setup

To use the senseBox with a solar panel, you only need a Powerboost and a [LiPo-battery](https://eckstein-shop.de/LiPo-Akku-Lithium-Ion-Polymer-Batterie-37V-2000mAh-JST-PH-Connector), around 1000 mAh should be enough. The powerboost guarentees, that the panel is loading the battery and the battery is powering the senseBox. We recommend a [Fire Bag](https://www.amazon.de/Jamara-141360-LiPo-Guard-Lipobrandschutztasche/dp/B003OFCUIS/ref=sr_1_18?keywords=LIPO+TRESOR&qid=1556284975&s=gateway&sr=8-18) for the battery, since there is a high risk of injury when damaged. The picture below shows how the parts are connected.

     >>WARNING-HINT<< <br>
     The LiPo battery and the Powerboost should best be protected from moisture when you operate the station outside. The matching housing is included in the set, but is also the same as e.g. for the fine dust sensor. Also watch out at minus temperatures, then you should bring the station indoors.
