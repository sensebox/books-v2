## Setup

To use the senseBox with a solar panel, you only need an [Adafruit Powerboost 1000C](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-powerboost-1000c-load-share-usb-charge-boost/overview) and a [LiPo-battery](https://www.amazon.de/Hubschrauber-F-645-1500mAh-Ersatzakku-Original-Blau/dp/B00YM3TL5Q/ref=pd_sim_21_6/257-8903357-8699938?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00YM3TL5Q&pd_rd_r=90464e67-6811-11e9-b934-e511ab4d5346&pd_rd_w=TePr1&pd_rd_wg=6fMkA&pf_rd_p=b0773d2f-6335-4e3d-8bed-091e22ee3de4&pf_rd_r=AC9A3TZNFFBTNH377BBN&psc=1&refRID=AC9A3TZNFFBTNH377BBN), around 1000 mAh should be enough. The powerboost guarentees, that the panel is loading the battery and the battery is powering the senseBox.
