## Setup

To use the senseBox with a solar panel, you only need an [Adafruit Powerboost 1000C](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-powerboost-1000c-load-share-usb-charge-boost/overview) and a [LiPo-battery](https://eckstein-shop.de/LiPo-Akku-Lithium-Ion-Polymer-Batterie-37V-2000mAh-JST-PH-Connector), around 1000 mAh should be enough. The powerboost guarentees, that the panel is loading the battery and the battery is powering the senseBox.
