In our [senseBox-Shop](https://sensebox.kaufen/) you will find a list of sensors we work with and therefore have written small instructions. For these sensors we offer you here information, but also help with connecting to the senseBox.

Here you will find information about the following sensors, just click on the name of the sensor and you will be redirected to a separate page

- [Temperature & air humidity (HDC1080)](hdc1080.md)
- [Air pressure & temperature](luftdruck-temperatur.md)
- [Exposure and UV](belichtung-und-uv.md)
- [Fine dust](feinstaub.md)
- [GPS](gps.md)
- [Soil Moisture](bodenfeuchte.md)

Of course, you can also connect any other sensor you know to the senseBox. However then you are asked as a tinkerer to figure out the wiring and programming ;) We would love to see you sharing information about your sensor and how you connected it to your senseBox so we can add it to our instruction.
