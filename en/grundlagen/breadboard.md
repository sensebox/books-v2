## Use of a Breadboard
The breadboard helps you to safely connect circuits without soldering. The electronic components are simply plugged into the spring contacts, so a circuit can be changed quickly by relocating.

The breadboard consists of two mirrored, non-conductive connected sides. These each consist of two long (horizontal in the following figure) rows for the plus and minus terminals and two times 30 (vertical rows in the following figure) rows of five spring contacts labeled a to e and f to j, respectively. The plus and minus terminals and the five horizontal spring contacts of a row are conductively connected as shown below.
