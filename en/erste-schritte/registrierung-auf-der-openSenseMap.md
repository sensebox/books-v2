# Step 6: Registration on the openSenseMap {#head}
<div class="description">In order to transfer the measured data to the openSenseMap, you must first register there and create a new senseBox. How to do that you will find out in the following section</div>

{% collapse title="What is the openSenseMap?" %}

The openSenseMap is a project to file, compare and visualize sensor data. Take a look at it by clicking on [www.opensensemap.org](https://www.opensensemap.org) and discover a vast data pool of sensor data from around the world. Not only senseBoxes send data to the openSenseMap but also other microcontroller with sensors. You can [here](https://sensebox.github.io/books-v2/osem) see how the individual functions of openSenseMap and their interfaces work.

## 1. Useraccount Registration
Please go to www.opensensemap.org and create an account. To do this, click on "Login" in the top right corner and then go to "Sign up". You need a valid e-mail address to register. After successful registration you will receive an e-mail with a confirmation link. Please click the link to complete the registration.

## 2. Set up a new sensBox
After successful registration you can start creating your senseBox. Click on "New senseBox / New senseBox" in your menu and confirm the terms of use. Follow the instructions of the registration and provide the following data:

* A freely selectable name of the senseBox
* The exposure, in which you want to set up your senseBox 
* The location, where you want to set up your senseBox (you can also have your location determined automatically)

Since the openSenseMap is open to all types of senseBoxes, you will be asked about the used hardware. Select * senseBox: home V2 * and the bee you use (WiFi, or Ethernet)

  You are not sure if you have an ethernet or a wifi-bee, or you cannot see the difference between the air pressure and temperature sensor? In the chapter <a href = "../komponenten/README.md">Box Content</a> you are going to find pictures and further hints for the individual components.
</div>

Now you are almost done! Quickly select the sensors that you will connect to your senseBox. Just click and ready. If you want to install a fine dust sensor, you also have to specify which serial port you want to connect to. After that you can finish the process.

{% collapse title="Why do I have to connect a fine dust sensor to the serial-port?" %}

Here should be an explanation

## 3. Receiving a Summary of the Registration
Once you have completed the registration, you must once again agree to the publication of your data. After that you will receive a summary of your registration. There you will see your senseBox ID, your sensor IDs and the Arduino code (you will also receive it via e-mail)  

![Summary of the registration. Here you can see the IDs to your senseBox and the sensors!](https://github.com/sensebox/resources/raw/master/gitbook_pictures/summary.PNG)

{% collapse title="What is my senseBox ID" %}

The senseBox ID is a unique identifier of your senseBox. With this ID you can find your senseBox for example with a URL on the opensenseMap (opensensemap.org/explore/HIER-DEINE-SENSEBOX-ID-EINGEBEN) or in a data pool. Furthermore, it is used for various applications and functions around the senseBox and the openSenseMap.

## Loading the Arduino-Code on the senseBox 
After you have downloaded the ```.ino``` attachment of the e-mail you have to load this program on to your senseBox. Of course you have to download the Arduino IDE (as explained in step 1) on your computer. In short, you can then follow the following steps:

(opensensemap.org/explore/ENTER-YOUR-SENSEBOX-HERE)

{% content "first" %}

### WiFi-Bee

* Open Arduino application
* Select ``Data`` → ``Open`` in the data bar and the choose ``sensebox.ino``
* The dialog field asks if you want to move the file. Confirm this with "Yes" or "Ok"
* Now you need to enter your WiFi network and password for the network between the ``""``. Please mind to not have any spaces between the  ``"`` and the letters of your password.  
* Now you can load the program via the arrow icon on the microcontroller.
* Wait until the program has been transferred

### Ethernet-Bee

* Open Arduino application
* Select ``Data`` → ``Open`` in the data bar and the choose ``sensebox.ino``
* The dialog field asks if you want to move the file. Confirm this with "Yes" or "Ok"
* Now you need to enter your WiFi network and password for the network between the ``""``. Please mind to not have any spaces between the  ``"`` and the letters of your password.  
* Now you can load the program via the arrow icon on the microcontroller.
* Wait until the program has been transferred

### LoRa-Bee

Unfortunately we have not been able to write a tutorial for the LoRa-Bee yet. If you would like to help us, please send us an e-mail to info@sensebox.de

If everything went right, you can now select your station on the openSenseMap and watch how measurements are transmitted continuously!

  You can not remember how to transfer the code from Arduino to the senseBox? Look again <a href="../erste-schritte/software-installation.html">Step 1</a> and <a href="../erste-schritte/komponenten-testen.html">Step 5</a> , the installation and the transfer will be explained there.
